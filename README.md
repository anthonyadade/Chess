I got into chess near the end of 2021, and quickly became a very fun hobbie to me. A year later, a coworker suggested to me that I create this game, as it would be a fun project and a good learning experience. Turns out it was! I had a lot of fun coding this, and learned a lot along the way, such as how to use the turtle library in python.

To run the program (Windows):
1. Click on the green 'Code' button, then 'Download ZIP'.
2. Extract the file to any folder.
3. Open the folder.
4. While in the folder, type 'cmd' in the title bar (where the filepath is displayed) of the file explorer.
5. Press enter, which will open command prompt.
6. If python is not installed, type 'python' in the command prompt and press enter. You can download it in the window that opens.
7. In the command prompt, type 'python main.py' and press enter.

Thank you for viewing!
