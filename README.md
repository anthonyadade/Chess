I got into chess near the end of 2021, and quickly became a very fun hobbie to me. A year later, a coworker suggested to me that I create this game, as it would be a fun project and a good learning experience. Turns out it was! I had a lot of fun coding this, and learned a lot along the way, such as how to use the turtle library in python.

To run the program using Windows:
1. Click on the green 'Code' button, then 'Download ZIP'.
2. Extract the file to any folder.
3. Open the folder.
4. While in the folder, type 'cmd' in the tile bar (where the filepath is displayed) of the file explorer.
5. Press Enter
6. In the Command Prompt that opens, type 'Python' and press enter.
7. If the Microsoft Store opens, it means python is not installed. You can download it in the window that opens.
8. Go back to the command prompt and type 'python main.py'

Thank you for viewing!
